                <div class="paragraph1">The display font for all of your editorial purposes. Vogue only wishes they found <span class="special-font">Brown Sugar</span> for their signature font. Keep dreaming Vogue.</div>

                    <p class="else">To capture the essence of the display font, the website is designed to feel editorial while maintaining a minimalist vibe. The goal is to play into the font name and style as much as possible by incorporating browns and soft colours. Each page is tied to the font name and style in a different way while maintaining a magazine or blog feel to create cohesion in the website.<br> 
                            The image page features a tranquil face made from overlapping text in the <span class="special-font">Brown Sugar</span> font in attempt to mimic a "profile page" in magazines. The image plays with the elegance of the font, and the sense of serenity of the image.<br>
                            The habitat page is my interpretation of what a magazine cover featuring <span class="special-font">Brown Sugar</span> would look like. It incorporates captions that play with the essence of the font with words like "soft, cozy and warm". <br>
                            Finally, the character page focuses on the letter <span class="special-font">W</span>. The combination of thick, harsh lines and thin, gentle lines encapsulates the overall sense of the font which is further studied in the Character page.<br>
                            The font Crimson Text is used as a supporting font for readability.<br>
                            The images portrayed on the home and habitat pages, as well as the background image, are not my own pictures, but are fitting to display the mood this font gave me. They all have brown, editorial vibes, matching the overall design concept I had in mind.<br>
                            Thanks for reading <span class="special-font">sugar, </span><br>
